# code_quiz

This project is being created to build a code quiz. As a software engineer, I want to learn how these quizes could work so that I may be prepared to take one in the future.

This project will have a start button that starts a timer.
When the timer starts the first question of the quiz will be presented.
After the quiz taker answers the question another will be presented.
If the wrong answer is provided, time will be subtracted from the clock.
After all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
When the game is over the quiz taker can provide their initials and save their score.
